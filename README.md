# Overview:

Disease ontology capturing most common diseases patients have, designed for instructional purposes:
- to better visualize diseases
- to observe an easy to understand and modify disease ontology
- less powerful but more understandable

## Steps to complete:
- [ ] Research and gather data about most common diseases and categorize their:
      - symptoms
      - treatment options
- [ ] Compile information into OWL-based ontology for clarity
- [ ] Specify how a user is to interact with the system,
      - to query for information on different diseases
      - how to check any symptoms against what exists in ontology

## Features:
- As user gives more info/data to the program, program will ask (differentiating) questions to narrow down a differential diagnosis (the process of differentiating between two or more conditions that share similar signs or symptoms) and present diseases matching these symptoms

## Tools:
- user interaction with ontology
  - built in Protege
- interaction with user
  - Python 2.7 with Tkinter GUI
