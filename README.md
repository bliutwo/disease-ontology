# Usage:
Run interface.py in Python 2.7.
```
python interface.py
```


# Overview:

This is a disease ontology capturing most common diseases patients have, designed for instructional purposes:
- to better visualize diseases
- to observe an easy to understand and modify disease ontology
- less powerful but more understandable

## Steps to complete:
- [ ] Research and gather data about most common diseases and categorize their:
  - symptoms
  - treatment options
  - ~~[ ] Instead of manually researching and gathering data about common diseases, write a Python file that searches and parses Google's medical Knowledge Representation to include symptoms and treatment options~~

- ~~[ ] Compile information into OWL-based ontology for clarity~~
- [ ] Specify how a user is to interact with the system,
  - to query for information on different diseases
  - how to check any symptoms against what exists in ontology

## Features:
- As user gives more info/data to the program, program will ask (differentiating) questions to narrow down a differential diagnosis (the process of differentiating between two or more conditions that share similar signs or symptoms) and present diseases matching these symptoms

## Tools:
- user interaction with ontology
  - ~~built in Protege~~
- interaction with user
  - Python 2.7 ~~with Tkinter GUI~~
